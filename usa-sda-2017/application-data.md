# Title of proposed project

Development of the PiBase Encyclopedia of Topological Spaces

# Abstract of the proposed project

The PiBase Encyclopedia of Topological Spaces is an open-source
web application with the ability to cross-reference topological spaces,
their properties, and the theorems which connect them. The similar
and more mature On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, launched in
its current form in late 2010, has been cited in over 5002 works.
The applicant will use support from this award to collaborate with
fellow researcher Ziqin Feng and PiBase's main programmer James Dabbs
to polish the PiBase software and database for increased competitiveness
in obtaining external funding, with the ultimate aim of establishing
the PiBase as a key tool in researching and cataloging topological spaces
and objects in other mathematical categories.
